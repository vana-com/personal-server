# Selfie

Selfie personalizes text generation, augmenting both local and hosted Large Language Models (LLMs) with your personal data. Selfie exposes an OpenAI-compatible API that wraps the LLM of your choice, and automatically injects relevant context into each text generation request.

## Features

* Automatically mix your data into chat and text completions using OpenAI-compatible clients like [OpenAI SDKs](https://platform.openai.com/docs/libraries), [SillyTavern](https://sillytavernai.com), and [Instructor](https://github.com/jxnl/instructor)* (untested).
* Quickly drop in personal messaging data exported from WhatsApp and Google Messages.
* Runs locally by default to keep your data private.
* Unopinionated compatibility with your LLM or provider of choice.
* Easily switch to vanilla text generation modes.

On the roadmap:
* Load data using any [LlamaHub loader](https://llamahub.ai/?tab=loaders) (partial support is available through the API).
* Directly and selectively query loaded data.
* Easy deployment with Docker and pre-built executables.

## Overview

Selfie is designed to compose well with tools on both sides of the text generation process. You can think of it as middleware that intelligently mixes your data into a request.

Typical request:
```
Application -(request)-> LLM
```

Request through Selfie:
```
Application -(request)-> Selfie -(request x data)-> LLM
                            |
                        Your Data
```

On the application side, Selfie exposes text generation APIs, including OpenAI-compatible endpoints.

On the LLM side, Selfie uses tools like LiteLLM and txtai to support forwarding data-augmented requests to your LLM of choice

## Getting Started

To launch Selfie, ensure that [python](https://www.python.org), [poetry](https://python-poetry.org), and [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) are installed. Then run the following commands in the project directory:

1. `git clone git@github.com:vana-com/selfie.git`
2. `cp selfie/.env.example selfie/.env`
3. `./scripts/build-ui.sh` (requires `yarn`)
4. `poetry install`, enable GPU or Metal acceleration via llama.cpp by subsequently installing GPU-enabled llama-cpp-python, see Scripts. _Note: if you are on macOS and do not have poetry installed, you can run `brew install poetry`_.
5. `poetry run python -m selfie`, or `poetry run python -m selfie --gpu` if your device is GPU-enabled. The first time you run this, it will download ~4GB of model weights. While you wait, you can download your WhatsApp or Google Takeout data for the next step.

[//]: # (Disable this note about installing with GPU support until supported via transformers, etc.)
[//]: # (3. `poetry install` or `poetry install -E gpu` &#40;to enable GPU devices via transformers&#41;. Enable GPU or Metal acceleration via llama.cpp by installing GPU-enabled llama-cpp-python, see Scripts.)

This starts a local web server and should launch the UI in your browser at http://localhost:8181. API documentation is available at http://localhost:8181/docs. Now that the server is running, you can use the API to import your data and connect to your LLM.

> Note: You can host selfie at a publicly-accessible URL with [ngrok](https://ngrok.com). Add your ngrok token (and optionally, ngrok domain) in `selfie/.env` and run `poetry run python -m selfie --share`.

### Step 1:  Gather Messaging Data

Future versions of Selfie will support loading any text data. For now, you can import chat logs from popular messaging platforms.

> Note: If you don't have any chat logs or want to try the app first, you can use the example chat logs provided in the `example-chats` directory.)

Export chats that you use frequently and contain information you want the LLM to know.

#### Export Instructions

The following links provide instructions for exporting chat logs from popular messaging platforms:

* [WhatsApp](https://faq.whatsapp.com/1180414079177245/?cms_platform=android)
* [Google](https://takeout.google.com/settings/takeout) (select Messages from the list)

These platforms are not yet supported, but you can create a parser in selfie/parsers/chats to support them (please contribute!):

* [Instagram](https://help.instagram.com/181231772500920)
* [Facebook Messenger](https://www.facebook.com/help/messenger-app/713635396288741/?cms_platform=iphone-app&helpref=platform_switcher)
* [Telegram](https://www.maketecheasier.com/export-telegram-chat-history/)

Ensure you ask permission of the friends who are also in the chats you export.

[//]: # (You can also redact their name, messages, and other personal information in later steps.)

### Step 2: Import Messaging Data

1. Place your exported chat logs in a directory on your computer, e.g. `/home/alice/chats`.
2. Open the UI at http://localhost:8181.
3. Add your directory as a Data Source. Give it a name (e.g. My Chats), enter the **absolute** path, and click `Add Directory`. This must be a directory (i.e. folder), not a file. Example absolute path would be: `/Users/{you}/Projects/selfie/example-chats`
4. In the Documents table, select the exported chat logs you want to import, and click `Index`.

If this process is successful, your selected chat logs will show as indexed in the table. You can now use the API to connect to your LLM and generate personalized text completions.

[//]: # (1. Open http://localhost:8181/docs)
[//]: # (2. Find `POST /v1/index_documents/chat-processor`)
[//]: # (3. Upload one or more exported chat log files. To get these files, export them from platforms that you use frequently and contain information you want the LLM to know. Exports: [WhatsApp]&#40;https://faq.whatsapp.com/1180414079177245/?cms_platform=android&#41; | [Google]&#40;https://takeout.google.com/settings/takeout&#41; | [Instagram]&#40;https://help.instagram.com/181231772500920&#41; | [Facebook Messenger]&#40;https://www.facebook.com/help/messenger-app/713635396288741/?cms_platform=iphone-app&helpref=platform_switcher&#41; | [Telegram]&#40;https://www.maketecheasier.com/export-telegram-chat-history/&#41;. Ensure you ask permission of the friend who is also in the chat you export. You can also redact their name, messages, and other personal information in later steps.)
[//]: # (4. Copy, paste, and edit the example parser_configs JSON. Include one configuration object in the list for each file you upload.)
[//]: # ()
[//]: # (![chat-processor.png]&#40;docs/images/chat-processor.png&#41;)
[//]: # ()
[//]: # (Setting `extract_importance` to `true` will give you better query results, but usually causes the import to take a while.)

### Step 3: Generate Personalized Text

You can quickly verify if everything is in order by visiting the summarization endpoint in your browser: http://localhost:8181/v1/index_documents/summary?topic=travel ([docs](http://localhost:8181/docs#/default/get_index_documents_summary_v1_index_documents_summary_get)).

Next, scroll down to the Playground section in the UI. Enter your name and a simple bio, and try asking some questions whose answers are in your chat logs.

## Usage Guide

By default, Selfie augments text completions with local models using llama.cpp and a local txtai embeddings database.

OpenAI-supported parameters like `messages`, `temperature`, `max_tokens`, etc., should all work out of the box, with some special considerations:

* `model` should be a local path, HuggingFace model name, or LiteLLM model name, depending on the method you choose.

You can also include special parameters to direct Selfie in how your request should be handled:

* `method`: The method to use for text generation. Options are `llama.cpp` for running local model files directly (e.g., `.gguf` files), and `litellm` for everything else.
* `api_base`: The base URL of an OpenAI-compatible API to use for text generation, e.g. if you want to host a local model with another tool.
* `api_key`: The API key required by your API at `api_base`.
* `disable_augmentation`: Set to `true` to generate text without data augmentation.

Examples and more details are provided in the next sections.

### Augmenting Local Models

Selfie uses [txtai](https://neuml.github.io/txtai) to download local models and run them with [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp). In completion requests, specify the `llama.cpp` method, or leave it off as the default, and ensure that your model is defined correctly, as a local path or HuggingFace model, according to [txtai's documentation](https://neuml.github.io/txtai/models).

```json
{
  "prompt": "What is the meaning of life?",
  "method": "llama.cpp",
  "model": "~/models/dolphin-2.6-mistral-7b-dpo.Q5_K_M.gguf"
}
```
or
```json
{
  "prompt": "What is the meaning of life?",
  "method": "llama.cpp",
  "model": "TheBloke/dolphin-2.6-mistral-7B-dpo-GGUF/dolphin-2.6-mistral-7b-dpo.Q5_K_M.gguf"
}
```
You can even use a local Open-AI compatible API ([LiteLLM OpenAI-Compatible Endpoints docs](https://litellm.vercel.app/docs/providers/openai_compatible)).
```json
{
  "method": "litellm",
  "api_base": "http://localhost:5000/v1",
  "api_key": "none"
}
```
Method is optional and defaults to `litellm` when `api_base` is specified.

### Augmenting Hosted Models

Selfie can use hosted model providers through [litellm](https://litellm.vercel.app). In completion requests, specify the `litellm` method (optional) and ensure that your model is prefixed correctly according to [litellm's documentation for your provider](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/providers).

```json
{
  "method": "litellm",
  "model": "replicate/llama-2-70b-chat:2796ee9483c3fd7aa2e171d38f4ca12251a30609463dcfd4cd76703f22e96cdf"
}
```

In general, you need an API key for your provided loaded into your environment. A quick way to do that is to specify it when you start the server:
`REPLICATE_API_KEY=replicatekey python -m selfie`.

### Vanilla Text Generation

Add `disable_augmentation: true` to your request body to generate text without data augmentation.

```json
{
  "prompt": "What is the meaning of life?",
  "method": "llama.cpp",
  "model": "~/models/dolphin-2.6-mistral-7b-dpo.Q5_K_M.gguf",
  "disable_augmentation": true
}
```

## Integration Recipes

Selfie can be used to augment text generation in a variety of applications. Here are some examples.

### Powering the OpenAI SDK

The OpenAI SDK is a popular way to access OpenAI's text generation models. You can use Selfie to augment the text completions that the SDK generates by setting the `apiBase` and `apiKey` parameters.

```js
import OpenAI from 'openai';

const openai = new OpenAI({
  baseURL: 'http://localhost:8181/v1',
  apiKey: ''
});

const name = 'Alice';
const chatCompletion = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  // model: 'TheBloke/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2-GGUF/mistral-7b-instruct-v0.2.Q5_K_M.gguf', // Optionally, customize the model used
  messages: [
    { role: 'system', content: `Write ${name}'s next reply in a fictional chat with ${name} and their friends.` },
    { role: 'user', content: 'Favorite ice cream?' },
  ]
} as any);

console.log(chatCompletion.choices[0].message.content);
// "Alice enjoys Bahn Mi and Vietnamese coffee."
```

### Powering SillyTavern

[SillyTavern](https://sillytavernai.com) is a self-hosted application that allows you to chat/roleplay with characters that you create. You can use Selfie to give SillyTavern characters some awareness of your data.

1. Install and run [SillyTavern](https://github.com/SillyTavern/SillyTavern).
2. Configure a custom chat completion source as  `http://localhost:8181`. You can customize the model by setting API parameters for `method` and `model` in Additional Parameters. \
   ![silly-tavern-api.png](docs/images/silly-tavern-api.png)
3. Create a character, customize the text generation settings, etc.
4. Chat with your character to see that it is aware of your data: \
   ![silly-tavern-chat.png](docs/images/silly-tavern-chat.png)

You can even tell Selfie to use an OpenAI-compatible API for the LLM that it augments:

Note that model is empty:
![silly-tavern-local-api-model.png](docs/images/silly-tavern-local-api-model.png)
We pass an extra parameter, `instruct_mode`, for text-generation-webui.
![silly-tavern-local-api.png](docs/images/silly-tavern-local-api.png)
> Note: some OpenAI-compatible APIs may not properly handle SillyTavern's use of multiple system messages and non-alternating user/assistant messages (like [text-generation-webui](https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui)). A text-generation-webui workaround is described [here](https://github.com/SillyTavern/SillyTavern/issues/1722#issuecomment-1902619716).
